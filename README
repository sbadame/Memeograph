What this program does: 
    Draws the stack and the heap of a running Java program in 3D

How to run:
    Use 'ant -p' to get a list of all of the public targets that you can run
    These change often so you're better off just running 'ant -p'

How does this program work?
    In simple terms here are the steps of execution:
        1.) Memeographer creates a JVM that runs a target program (called the SuT for System Under Test)
        2.) Memeographer attaches to that JVM and starts listening for calls to memeographer.Memeographer.step()
        3.) Every time Memeographer grapher sees that function being called it will temporarily suspend the execution of all threads in SuT  generate an object graph of the program.
        4.) The JVM exits, Memeographer has it's graphs.
        5.) The graphs are rendered for the user. (Yay!)

    In reality the ordering of these events can vary, but right now that doesn't really happen

How does the code work?
    Documenting that here is just asking for pain since things change.
    But here are some ideas that I don't think will change:
        Right now the "core" of Memeographer are just the four classes in the memeograph packeage. 3 out of those 4 contain only a handful of code.
        For information about how the code fits together:
            memeograph.Memeographer //Information about the life cycle of the program
            memeograph.Config       //Information about how objects are created, configured and extended
            memeograph.graph.Node   //Information about how nodes in the graph store information

Current Features missing that shouldn't take much work add (ie. Features that can be implemented in less that a day's work):
    - Bring back the ability to customize color and text again.
    - Creating a UI for Memeoframe. I'm thinking using swing for that, since processing doesn't have much for GUI widgets. (And it's shouldn't that not what it's meant for.)
    - Implementing the physics layout for GraphLayoutHandler (Where did all of that phsyics code go anyway?)
    - Bring back the animations for transitioning between graphs.
    - Multithreading the creation of graphs and rendering to be a producer/consumer type of relationship.
        - Note this is the main reason that generator returns an iterator and not a list, the whole set of graphs need not be all totally created when the renderer gets it's hands on it.
    - Why doesn't OpenGL work? This is just a jogl issue. No java code probably needs to be touched, just the jars/libs need to be configured.
    - Have the stackframe display the actual line of code that is beign run in that frame. (Modification to StackFrameNode would be needed.)

Current Features that I want to see that will take lots of work:
    - Getting it to work with jython,closure,scala and some of the more badass JVM languages
    - Attachment to an IDE plugin so that more "novice" users can take advantage of this
