/**
 * Seriously, this is the whole program in a nutshell.
 * Config takes the args from the commandline and from default.properties
 *  - Look into Config to see how the GraphRenderer and Generator are chosen
 *
 * The GraphRenderer actually gets created first. Since the renderer is mostly
 * a GUI (The Processing Applet) it can be useful to have it pop up first
 * and let the user know what the graph generator is about to get it to work.
 * You can also get clever and use the renderer to maybe set some options for
 * the generator by blocking in init() until you're ready.
 *
 * The GraphGenerator gets going and starts to generate a graph that
 * gets passed to the Renderer.
 *
 * The program then exits.
